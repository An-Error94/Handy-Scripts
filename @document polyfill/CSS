/*
Thanks to the JavaScript, on every web page we get "head" elements with the "data-at-document" attribute
whose value is full domain name under which the document is located in which the script is running.
So we have something like this:
<html ... data-at-document="developer.mozilla.org"> on page https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/...
or
<html ... data-at-document="www.mozilla.org"> on page https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/
or
<html ... data-at-document="github.com"> on page https://github.com/An-Error94/Handy-Scripts/...

Now we can use the attribute selectors (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)
to select those html elements that have the desired value of the "data-at-document" attribute.

We can select the html elements whose "data-at-document" attribute has the value exactly (=):
- mozilla.org:
html[data-at-document="mozilla.org"]

We can also choose those html elements whose value of attribute "data-at-document" is suffixed (followed) ($=) by value:
- mozilla.org:
html[data-at-document$="mozilla.org"]

The above selector will match:
<html ... data-at-document="www.mozilla.org">
and
<html ... data-at-document="developer.mozilla.org">
and unfortunately
<html ... data-at-document="wrongmozilla.org">    


NOT READY!
