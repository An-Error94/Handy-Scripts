Thanks to JavaScript, we get "head" elements on each web page with the attributes:
- "Data-at-document-domain"
whose value is the full name of the domain under which the document is located in which the script is running,
and
"Data-at-document-url"
which contains the URL of the document.

General idea of how this polyfill works:

The @document rule is only supported in firefox, while the attribute selector:
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) is widely supported.
You can use attribute selectors on attributes created by the script.

Then use Descendant combinator (space): (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator)
to indicate that the item you are looking for is contained in an "html" element with the appropriate attribute values,
i.e. it is simply on the page that has the desired address or is on the desired domain.

Only now can you use the right selector of any level of complexity, referring to a particular page element,
e.g. each visited link ("a: visited" selector).

Replacing function url():

use 'html[data-at-document-url^="ad"] ' instead of: 'url-prefix("http://www.w3.org/Style/")'
