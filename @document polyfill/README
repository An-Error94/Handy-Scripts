My goal was to show how to replace the CSS @document rule in combination with function: url(), url-prefix() and domain()
in user stylesheet (which is located in: [profile directory]/chrome/userContent.css in case firefox web browser)
so that it can be used in any web browser.

Unfortunately, you also need JavaScript in the user to do this.
Unfortunately, for this purpose you also need a user script in JavaScript, and therefore an add-on e.g. Greasemonkey.

I will never ever work on solving the problem of replacing the regexp() function or the media-document() function -
it is too difficult and what I have done is enough for me.

The way how my polyfill works is in the comments in the code and in the file called Instruction.
